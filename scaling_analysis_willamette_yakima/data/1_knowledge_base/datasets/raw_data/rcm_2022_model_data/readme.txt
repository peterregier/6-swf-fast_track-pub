This dataset was clipped from the Columbia River Basin dataset to obtain values 
corresponding to the Yakima and Willamette River Watershed only. We subsetted the original dataset
By using a reference list of "comid's" from the enhanced NHDPlus V.2. We subsetted the 
enhanced NHDPlus V.2. using the huc_4, which we derived as the first four digits
of the "reachcode" variable. Thus, most our datasets, unless indicated otherwise
correspond the the huc_4 1703 and 1709 for the Yakima and Willamette River Basins
respectively.  

Our version of this dataset contains only selected .csv files corresponding to substrate concentrations (e.g., DO, DOC, and NO3), stream orders, and NEXSS inputs to the RCM model including
Residence time, D50, and exchange fluxes. 

Additional data corresponding to Random Forest Predictions for missing values for respiration were added as son_etal_22_**_RF_resp_data. ** corresponds to the watershed (Willamette or Yakima)
