# River Corridor model used five key inputs: stream DOC, nitrate, and DO concentrations, and HZ exchange flux and residence time

1) nhd_CR_stream_annual_resp_inputs_outputs.rda
This file includes the annual stream DOC (pred_annual_DOC), nitrate(no3_conc_mg_l) and DO concentration(pred_annual_DO) and HZ exchange flux (logq_hz_total_m_s) 
and residence time (logRT_total_hz_s), and modeled HZ respiration (aerobic and anaerboic and total respiration)
aerobic respiration:logtotco2_o2g_m2_day
