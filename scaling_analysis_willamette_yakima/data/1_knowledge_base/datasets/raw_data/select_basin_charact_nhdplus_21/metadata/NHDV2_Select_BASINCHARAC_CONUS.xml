      <abstract>This tabular data set represents select basin characteristics compiled for two spatial components of the NHDPlus version 2 data suite (NHDPlusv2) for the conterminous United States; 1) individual reach catchments and 2) reach catchments accumulated upstream through the river network. The select variables in this data set are parsed out into six different file themes as follows: 

BASIN_CHAR_XXX_CONUS.txt (where XXX is CAT flowline catchment value, ACC is divergence routed accumulated value, and TOT is total upstream routed accumulated value) contains information on stream slope (percent rise, also referred to as the percent slope), basin slope (percent rise, also referred to as the percent slope), basin area, minimum basin elevation, maximum basin elevation, mean basin elevation, and stream length. 

RDX_CONUS.txt contains information on road and stream crossings. 

ROAD_DENS_XXX_CONUS.txt (where XXX is CAT flowline catchment value, ACC is divergence routed accumulated value, and TOT is total upstream routed accumulated value) contains information on road density by road type.

STREAM_DENSITY_CONUS.TXT stream density, contains information on stream density (stream kilometers per square kilometer of basin).

SINUOSITY_CONUS.txt contains information on flowline reach sinuosity. 

FTYPE_PCT_CONUS.txt contains information on each flowline reach type as a percentage to all flowline features per catchment. 

This dataset can be linked to the NHDPlus version 2 data suite by the unique identifier COMID.  The source data is the NHDPlus Version 2 data suite (U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), 2012).  Reach catchment information characterizes data at the local scale. Reach catchments accumulated upstream through the river network characterizes cumulative upstream conditions.  Network-accumulated values are computed using two methods, 1) divergence-routed and 2) total cumulative drainage area. Both approaches use a modified routing database to navigate the NHDPlus reach network to aggregate (accumulate) the metrics derived from the reach catchment scale. (Schwarz and Wieczorek, 2018).</abstract>
      <purpose>This data set was created by the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) National Water-Quality Assessment Project (NAWQA) which is part of the USGS National Water Quality Program (NWQP).  This effort was undertaken to estimate select basin characteristics for NHDPlusV2 flowline catchments and upstream river networks to support statistical analysis, map display, and model parameterization.</purpose>
      <supplinf>The data processed here uses a modified routing data base for the NHDPlusV2 flowline network (ENHDPlusV2_us, Schwarz and Wieczorek, 2018). The NHDPlusV2 flowline network serves as the spatial infrastructure for many water-quality modeling efforts included under NAWQA Cycle 3 status and trend assessments including the SPARROW (SPAtially Referenced Regressions On Watershed attributes) model (Rowe and others, 2009). The NHDPlusV2 flowline network is a publically available digital geospatial framework (database) that depicts the network of stream segments and their catchments within the conterminous United States (see Moore and Dewald, 2016 for more detail). The NHDPlusv2 data set includes catchments for each reach covering the conterminous U.S. which includes the catchment boundaries in neighboring Canada and Mexico. These catchments are used as the spatial units for zonal statistics. A statistic (summation, average, minimum or maximum) is calculated for each zone (catchment), based on values from the source ancillary data set (See Process_Description for more details). The output of these values are used as the source input data for an accumulation program which uses a routing database to allocate and accumulate landscape metrics. This database  (ENHDPlusV2_us) is based on a topologically reconditionedversion of the NHDPlusV2 hydrography network and is used for routing purposes only. No cartographic changes were made to the original NHDPlusV2 in either the flowline or catchment line work.</supplinf>

      <attraccr>Basin metrics were compared to values for the variables, ELEV_MEAN_M_BASIN_30M' ELEV_MAX_M_BASIN_30M, ELEV_MIN_M_BASIN_30M, and SLOPE_PCT_30M, available in the GAGESII data set (Falcone, 2010).  The following steps were performed before making the comparisons:

1) GAGESII point file with the most current COMIDs associations was joined to the routing database file which contains accumulated basin areas (Schwarz and Wieczorek, 2018).
2) Only those GAGESII basins that have a basin area within 1% or less of the accumulated basin areas were processed and used for comparisons. This resulted in 4,713 locations.
3) Using those COMIDs for GAGESII sites, the associated record in the accumulation files were pulled and used in the comparison of one to one plots.

Results demonstrated a Pearson's r-squared well over 90%. Values that differed greatly between data sets can be attributed to either the difference in the basin delineations of GAGESII basins compared to that of the catchment representations in NHDPlus version 2 or to the fact that this data set only reports data from the downstream end of reaches and their upstream contribution. GAGESII basin outlets can occur anywhere along a reach segment which can produce different results depending on the variability of the source data being compiled and the distance between the GAGES II basin outlet and the downstream endpoint of the reach segment. NHDPlus version 2 reach segments can be as long as 95 kilometers and some source data can vary considerably within an NHDPlus reach catchment. As a result, some data processed from the location of a GAGESII pour point compared to the downstream end of a reach segment can result in differences in accumulated variables.</attraccr>

        <procdesc>This tabular data set represents select basin characteristics compiled for two spatial components of the NHDPlus version 2 data suite (NHDPlusv2) for the conterminous United States; 1) individual reach catchments and 2) reach catchments accumulated upstream through the river network. Both approaches use a modified routing database to navigate the NHDPlus reach network to aggregate (accumulate) the metrics derived from the reach catchment scale (Schwarz and Wieczorek, 2018). 
These data sets can be linked to the NHDPlus version 2 data suite by the unique identifier COMID. The select variables in these data sets are parsed out into six different file themes and processed as follows: 

BASIN_CHAR_XXX_CONUS.txt (where XXX is CAT flowline catchment value, ACC is divergence routed accumulated value, and TOT is total upstream routed accumulated value) contains information on stream slope (percent rise, also referred to as the percent slope), basin slope (percent rise, also referred to as the percent slope), basin area, minimum basin elevation, maximum basin elevation, mean basin elevation, and stream length. 
Stream slope was taken directly from the NHDPlusV2 table, elevslope.dbf found under the NHDPlusAttributes folder.
Basin slope in percent was calculated with the following steps:
1) Downloaded elevation data in 30-meter format from http://www.horizon-systems.com/nhdplus/
2) Used the SLOPE command to calculate slope in percent.
3) Summarized the mean slope by catchment using the ZonalStatisticsAsTable function.
Basin area was taken directly from the NHDPlucV2 catchment.shp file's item, AreaSqKM for each catchment.
Mean reach catchment elevation was calculated with the following steps:
1) Downloaded elevation data in 30-meter format from http://www.horizon-systems.com/nhdplus/
2) Summarized the elevation by catchment using the ZONALMEAN, ZONALMIN, and ZONALMAX commands.
Stream length was taken directly from the NHDPlusV2 NHDflowline.shp file's item, LENGTHKM for each flowline reach.

FTYPE_PCT_CONUS.txt  contains information on each flowline reach type as a percentage to all flowline features per catchment. Each percentage of flowline reach's type is calculated against the sum of all flowline reach types (FTYPE length/sum of all FTYPE lengths) per catchment(s).

RDX_CONUS.txt contains information on TIGER roads and stream crossings. Number of road crossings per reach was calculated by intersecting the road coverage with the NHDPlus stream coverage and summing the intersections.

ROAD_DENS_XXX_CONUS (where XXX is CAT flowline catchment value, ACC is divergence routed accumulated value, and TOT is total upstream routed accumulated value) contains information on road density by road type. Each percentage of TIGER road types is calculated against the sum of all TIGER road types (ROAD type length/sum of all Road type lengths) per catchment(s).

SINUOSITY_CONUS.txt contains information on flowline reach sinuosity at the flowline reach scale only. No accumulation was done for this variable. Sinuosity is calculated by taking the reach length (in meters) and dividing it by its straight line length (in meters). Straight line length is measured from the beginning node of a reach to the end node of the reach. 

STREAM_DENSITY_CONUS.txt (where XXX is CAT flowline catchment value, ACC is divergence routed accumulated value, and TOT is total upstream routed accumulated value) contains information on the density of streams defined as stream length (meters) divided by catchment(s) area (square meters).</procdesc>

The NHDFlowline feature type connector establishes a known, but non-specific (unseen) connection between two non-adjacent geometric network (flowline) segments that have flow. These features are usually associated with the results of a dye-trace injection that ties the two surface water features together through some groundwater connection. If there is a visible surface connection, example a culvert, manmade tunnel, or pipelines users should not use connector to define the interaction. -9999 denotes flow line reach is disconnected from the network and has no catchment or not part of the network and cannot be accumulated.</attrdef>
