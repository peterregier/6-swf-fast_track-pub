This dataset was clipped from Region 17 (Pacific Northwest) dataset to obtain values 
corresponding to the Yakima and Willamette River Watershed only. We subsetted the 
NSI Hydrography network "Flowline_PN17_NSI.shp" using the huc_4, which we derived as the 
first four digits of the "reachcode" variable. Thus, most our datasets, unless indicated otherwise
correspond the the huc_4 1703 and 1709 for the Yakima and Willamette River Basins
respectively. 

The NSI network is a conditioned set of flow lines that using the tools of the STARS Toolkit, ensures
Connectivity and feasibility of the network to be used in spatial stream network statistical
Analyses. We use these shape files as spatial reference for mapping our dataset and potentially
For spatial interpolation of missing values from the River Corridors Model output.
