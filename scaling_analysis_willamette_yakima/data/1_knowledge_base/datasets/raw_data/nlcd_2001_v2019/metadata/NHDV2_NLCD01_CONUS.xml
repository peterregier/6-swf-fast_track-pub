      <abstract>This tabular data set represents the percent of land cover classes from the 2001 National Land Cover Dataset compiled for two spatial components of the NHDPlus version 2 data suite (NHDPlusv2) for the conterminous United States; 1) individual reach catchments and 2) reach catchments accumulated upstream through the river network. This dataset can be linked to the NHDPlus version 2 data suite by the unique identifier COMID.  The source data is the "National Land Cover Database 2001" produced by the United States Geological Survey (Homer and others, 2007). Units are percent. The "National Land Cover Database 2001" (NLCD 2001) is a 16-class (additional four classes in Alaska only) land cover classification scheme that has been applied consistently across all 50 United States and Puerto Rico at a spatial resolution of 30 meters. Reach catchment information characterizes data at the local scale. Reach catchments accumulated upstream through the river network characterizes cumulative upstream conditions.  Network-accumulated values are computed using two methods, 1) divergence-routed and 2) total cumulative drainage area. Both approaches use a modified routing database to navigate the NHDPlus reach network to aggregate (accumulate) the metrics derived from the reach catchment scale. (Schwarz and Wieczorek, 2018).</abstract>
      <purpose>This data set was created by the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) National Water-Quality Assessment Project (NAWQA) which is part of the USGS National Water Quality Program (NWQP).  This effort was undertaken to estimate the 2001 land cover for NHDPlusV2 flowline catchments and upstream river networks to support statistical analysis, map display, and model parameterization.</purpose>
      <supplinf>The data processed here uses a modified routing data base for the NHDPlusV2 flowline network (ENHDPlusV2_us, Schwarz and Wieczorek, 2018). The NHDPlusV2 flowline network serves as the spatial infrastructure for many water-quality modeling efforts included under NAWQA Cycle 3 status and trend assessments including the SPARROW (SPAtially Referenced Regressions On Watershed attributes) model (Rowe and others, 2010). The NHDPlusV2 flowline network is a publically available digital geospatial framework (database) that depicts the network of stream segments and their catchments within the conterminous United States (see Moore and Dewald, 2016 for more detail). The NHDPlusV2 data set includes catchments for each reach covering the conterminous U.S. which includes the catchment boundaries in neighboring Canada and Mexico. These catchments are used as the spatial units for zonal statistics. A statistic (summation, average, minimum or maximum) is calculated for each zone (catchment), based on values from the source ancillary data set (See Process_Description for more details). The output of these values are used as the source input data for an accumulation program which uses a routing database to allocate and accumulate landscape metrics. This database  (ENHDPlusV2_us) is based on a topologically reconditionedversion of the NHDPlusV2 hydrography network and is used for routing purposes only. No cartographic changes were made to the original NHDPlusV2 in either the flowline or catchment line work.</supplinf>

    <attracc>
      <attraccr>Basin metrics were compared to values for the same variables available in the GAGESII data set (Falcone et al., 2010).  The following steps were performed before making the comparisons:

1) GAGESII point file with the most current COMIDs associations was joined to the routing database file which contains accumulated basin areas (Schwarz and Wieczorek, 2018).
2) Only those GAGESII basins that have a basin area within 1% or less of the accumulated basin areas were processed and used for comparisons. This resulted in 4,713 locations.
3) Using those COMIDs for GAGESII sites, the associated record in the accumulation files were pulled and used in the comparison of one to one plots.

Results demonstrated a Pearson's r-squared well over 90%.  Values that differed greatly between datasets can be attributed to either the difference in the basin delineations of GAGESII basins compared to that of the catchment representations in NHDPlus version 2 or to the fact that this data set only reports data from the downstream end of reaches and their upstream contribution. GAGESII basin outlets can occur anywhere along a reach segment which can produce different results depending on the variability of the source data being compiled and the distance between the GAGES II basin outlet and the downstream endpoint of the reach segment. NHDPlus version 2 reach segments can be as long as 95 kilometers and some source data can vary considerably within an NHDPlus reach catchment. As a result, some data processed from the location of a GAGESII pour point compared to the downstream end of a reach segment can result in differences in accumulated variables.</attraccr>
