This is a vector-format map (polyline shapefiles) of the median bed-material sediment particle size (D50) over the contiguous United States. This map is derived by combining the USGS sediment observations, the channel and watershed characteristics from two existing datasets (medium-resolution NHDplus and ScienceBase), and state-of-the-art machine learning techniques.
