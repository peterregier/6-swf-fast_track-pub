Blodgett, D.L., 2023, Updated CONUS river network attributes based on the E2NHDPlusV2 and NWMv2.1 networks: U.S. Geological Survey data release, https://doi.org/doi:10.5066/P976XCVT

Changes in version 2.0

1. A bug in a data procesing workflow was fixed. The code in question was not applying all diversion changes from the E2NHDPlusV2 dataset. The change results in many of the diversion alterations from the E2NHDPlusV2 dataset being included and, as a result, many of the derived network attributes have changed. This change has no structural or functional impact on the dataset. However, primary paths downstream through diversions and upstream through confluences have been altered in many places.
