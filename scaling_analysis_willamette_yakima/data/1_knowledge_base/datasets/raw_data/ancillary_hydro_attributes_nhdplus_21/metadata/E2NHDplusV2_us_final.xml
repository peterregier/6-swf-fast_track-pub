      <abstract>The National Hydrography Dataset Plus, Version 2  (NHDPlusV2) is an attribute rich, digital hydrologic network for the Conterminous U.S. developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). SPAtially Referenced Regressions On Watershed attributes (SPARROW), is a process-based/statistical model that relies on a digital hydrologic network, like NHDPlusV2, in order to establish spatial relations between monitored contaminant loads, contaminant sources, and other watershed characteristics. The USGS National Water Quality Assessment (NAWQA) project adopted the medium-resolution NHDPlusV2 network as the primary framework supporting SPARROW modeling, and has become a unifying system for reporting hydrologic information. This metadata describes enhancements made to improve the routing capabilities and ancillary hydrologic attributes of NHDPlusV2 to support modeling and other hydrologic analyses. The resulting enhanced network is named E2NHDPlusV2_us.</abstract>
      <purpose>These data represent a topologically reconditioned version of the NHDPlusV2 routing network (McKay and others, 2012), including enhanced attributes to improve flow routing and the physical description of flowlines. The modifications pertain only to NHDPlus data table values; no physical changes were made to the spatial locations of flowlines or catchments. The approach assumes the pre-existence of the NHDPlus network and its attributes, although many of the attributes can be generated without reference to existing values. The enhanced dataset, named E2NHDPlusV2_us, represents a national framework useful for the hydrologic referencing of spatial data, and is an extension of the work in Schwarz and Wieczorek, 2018. The data are useful to hydrologic modeling, such as the SPARROW water-quality model, and other analyses relating spatial features to hydrologic data.</purpose>
      <supplinf>Details of methods are described in Brakebill and others, 2019, and in Schwarz and Wieczorek, 2018.</supplinf>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Below is a sequential description of SAS scripts executed to make and modify network routing and ancillary attributes. Processing took place between March, 2015 and March 2017. SAS Scripts used to modify attributes and create the E2NHDPlusV2_us data file are located in the scripts.zip folder. To replicate the development process, run the following SAS scripts sequentially (1 - 18) in the listed order. Some scripts require user created ancillary information stored in .xlsx files (AREvents_final7.xlsx and div_modify.xlsx), and are noted below. These files and associated readme files for further explanation are located in the supplemental_files.zip file.

All SAS scripts have extensive comment information regarding settings and function for the script. Please see these sections, grouped by /* and */ comment symbols  throughout the scripts for more details.

1. make_nhdplusv2.sas - merges all downloaded NHDPlus files into single data set and generates compact values for from and to nodes.

2. fix_nhdplusv2.sas - fills in missing values, fixes known errors.
Attributes were renamed, duplicate observations removed, missing values corrected, revisions to routing including adjustments to diversion codes and fraction of flow diverted. These corrections are described in detail in the ENHDPlusV2_us metadata (Schwarz and Wieczorek, 2018) and in Brakebill and others, 2019).

2a. Make a Backup of the network from above, called rnhdplusv2_us

3. make_shapefile_selectpoints.sas - reads NHDPlusV2 flowline shapefiles and outputs point locations (lat/lon) of nodes and midpoint

4. make_nhdplus_ifextterm.sas - reads NHD nodes lat/lon file from above (#3) and identifies flowlines that terminate at US border

5. mod_nhdplus_arevents.sas - reads AREvents_final7.xlsx and modifies NHDPlus to account for AR events - creates new virtual flowlines for select transfers. Addition and removal (AR) events were documented in the file ARevents_final7.xlsx file and described. This file captures user determination of the location and amount of flow diverted as described in Brakebill and others, 2019. Not all attributes are preserved in the resulting E2NHDPlusV2_us file. These attributes are described in the .xlsx file AREvents.xlsx. Pesudo flowlines were added in AREvents_final7.xlsx so the routing could be included in the network routing. Pseudo flowlines were assigned COMIDs in a special range (less than -90000000) to distinguish them in the network from standard flowlines. Pseudo flowlines also were assigned a length of zero, the implication being that no instream losses could occur on the pseudo portion of the revised network, which would be consistent with the assumed properties of routed transfers. Multiple pseudo flowlines were permitted to merge either at a common node of the pseudo network or as discharge to a common node on the NHDPlusV2 network. From and To-nodes may be created to support the pseudo flowlines for routed transfers in the AR process. These nodes were assigned as the next sequential numbers beyond the maximum values of the both the compactified nodes and regular nodes. Therefore, these nodes are both unique and automatically compact. Disconnected AR withdrawal/discharge events (including non-routed transfers) were assumed to connect to the specific flowline they reference. ARQuantity describes the amount of flow withdrawn or diverted. Compact sequential hydrologic sequence values are assigned upstream order (largest value is upstream) and stored in  HYDROSEQ.  

6. mod_nhdplus_routing.sas - reads div_modify.xlsx and modifies NHDPlus routing and diversions. Diversion affected flowlines were cataloged in the file div_modify.xlsx. This file documents a list of modified diversion codes and diversion fractions that were updated in the E2NHDPlusV2_us dataset. This file is created by the user, as described in Brakebill and others, 2019. The file is read by the SAS program mod_nhdplus_routing.sas, and alterations to the diversion code (divergence), the diversion fraction (DivFrac), and direction of flow (HYDROSEQ, from and to-nodes) are modified based on these values. Compact sequential hydrologic sequence values are assigned upstream order (largest value is upstream) and stored in  HYDROSEQ. Any additional updates to the network would require a new file created containing the modifications. See readme_diversion.txt in the supplemental_files.zip.

7. make_nhdplus_usarea.sas - creates share (fraction) of incremental and cumulative area in US variables

8. make_nhdplus_divvars.sas - creates the diversion affected flowline variables

9. merge_nhdplus_files.sas  - merges ancillary data sets usarea divvars with nhdplus file (usarea divvars)

10. make_nhdplus_totvars.sas - creates total and cumulative upstream variables [generates index files to speed subsequent processing]

11. merge_nhdplus_files.sas  - Modify "%let ancil_files =" line to merge ancillary data set totvars with nhdplus file (totvars) created using previously run scripts noted above

12. make_nhdplus_pctunrslvd.sas - creates variable percent unresolved area due to diversions

13. make_nhdplus_vaavars.sas - creates value added attribute variables

14. make_nhdplus_elevvars.sas - creates slope and elevation variables

15. make_nhdplus_flowvel.sas - creates flow and velocity variables

16. merge_nhdplus_files - Modify "%let ancil_files =" line to merge all (pctunrslvd vaavars elevvars flowvel) created using previously run scripts noted above

17. make_nhdplus_regions.sas - creates regional breakout dbf files for use with GIS

18. revise_postmod_nhdplus.sas - Alternatively, can execute scripts numbered 1-6 (noted above) individually and then run revise_postmod_nhdplus. Program combines individual programs to update subsets of NHDPlus variables in response to routing revisions implemented by the mod_nhdplusV2.sas program. 

For additional modifications to routing or AR events (number 5 and 6 above), create new Excel files:
div_modify.xlsx and AREvents_final7.xlsx containing only the new changes. Then
run scripts 5 and 6 and then the revise_postmod_nhdplus.sas program (18).

Details of methods are described in Brakebill and others, 2019, and in Schwarz and Wieczorek, 2018.</procdesc>
